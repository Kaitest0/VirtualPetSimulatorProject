I created branch AddingPetAction yesterday. But, the codes are not push correctly. I am correcting them today.<br/>
This branch is for the PetAction<br/>
Feeding the pet ->  Decreases hunger, slightly increases health <br/>
Playing with the pet -> Increases happiness, increases hunger <br/>
Let the pet rest -> Improves health, decreases happiness. <br/>

In the code, the activies are defined by 1,2,3,4,5. <br/>
1.  is for feeding <br/>
2.  is for playing <br/>
3. is for resting <br/>
4. is for to get the current status of the pet <br/>
5. is to exit the application.
